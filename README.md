# **PYHOCK**

<img src="Generally/LOGO_PYHOCK.jpg" alt="Logo" height="150">
PYHOCK is a file encryption and decryption program, written in Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) that uses PyQt5.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: PYHOCK can encrypt any file on your system. You can provide a custom encryption key, or you can allow the program to automatically generate a strong, secure key for you.

- **File Decryption**: Once a file has been encrypted, PYHOCK can also decrypt it, provided the correct key is supplied. This feature can be used to access encrypted files or to reverse the encryption process if necessary.

- **Key Generation**: If you need a strong, secure key for encryption, PYHOCK can generate one for you with a single click. This key can then be used to encrypt or decrypt files.

- **User Interface Customization**: PYHOCK comes with both a light and a dark mode, so you can choose the one that is most comfortable for your eyes. Switching between modes is easy and instant.

- **Ease of Use**: With its simple and intuitive graphical user interface, PYHOCK is easy to use even for those who are not familiar with file encryption and decryption. Everything you need is just a few clicks away.
